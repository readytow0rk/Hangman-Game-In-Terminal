Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Change to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd hangman-game
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

Copy code

How to Play
The game will prompt you to enter your name. Enter your name and press Enter.

You will be given a randomly selected word, and a series of dashes representing the letters of the word.

Guess a letter by typing it and pressing Enter. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the corresponding position(s). If the letter is not in the word, you will lose one of your attempts.

Keep guessing letters until you have guessed all the letters in the word or you have run out of attempts.

If you have guessed all the letters in the word, you win! If you run out of attempts before guessing the word, you lose.

The game will ask if you want to play again. Enter 'Y' to play again or 'N' to exit the game.
